## Dezirae Britton Lab 4 
### Proportional Symbol
#### Map: Arizona County Median Income

#### Reflection
* Despite how difficult this map was, in the end I did feel like I learned a lot. My main takeway was how important it is to work with a team. Something I have been struggling with is not having the classroom community. Just simply being in a classroom setting helps my brain recall and focus. So working with peers this week made me feel supported and understood.

###### What Did Not  Work
* I tried to be fancy and add a hover over the circles that showed the number of each counties median income but it would not respond. I hope to improve my detail within maps in the future because I appreciate when maps have usable information in corresponding locations. 

###### What Did Work
* I was able to successfully organize and troubleshoot my data variables. I learned a lot about how space sensative and variable names are. This lab really made my brian connect how code works in relation to structure.
